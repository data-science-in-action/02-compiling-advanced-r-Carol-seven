# README
* *Problems&Solutions.Rmd* is a report for recording the problems and solutions encountered in the process of building the book **Advanced R Programming** using [*RStudio*].
* The album *image* is used to store the pictures in *Problems&Solutions.Rmd*.
* *main.pdf* is the result of compilation.
* In order to facilitate browsing, I have specially created an md file *Problems_and_Solutions.md*, which includes not only the content of *Problems&Solutions.Rmd*, but also the mutual communication and learning between me and some classmates. I recommend this md file more.
